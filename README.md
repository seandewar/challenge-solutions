# Sean's Challenge Solutions Repository
_My personal repository for solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (&
previously, some [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) problems._

I try to annotate every solution with a link to their respective questions,
comments regarding their time & space complexities and other notes, while also
sometimes providing alternative solutions you may want to consider.

The directory structure is pretty straightforward, with solutions grouped in
directories indicating their respective question's difficulty (usually "easy",
"medium" or "hard", as ranked by the website the question is from).

You may see my programming style change every-so-often (e.g widespread use of
brace initialization syntax in some C++ solutions), as I find this to be the
perfect place for experimentation.
