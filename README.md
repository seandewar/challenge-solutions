# Sean's Challenge Solutions Repository
This is my personal repository for solutions to programming puzzles from various
websites, including:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
- [TUHH's System Call Advent Calendar](https://osg.tuhh.de/Advent/)

I try to annotate most Leetcode solutions with a link to their respective
questions, comments regarding their time & space complexities and other notes,
while also sometimes providing alternative solutions you may want to consider.

The directory structure is pretty straightforward, with solutions grouped in
directories indicating their respective question's difficulty (usually "easy",
"medium" or "hard", as ranked by the website the question is from).

You may see my programming style change every-so-often (e.g widespread use of
brace initialization syntax in some C++ solutions), as this is a good place to
experiment.
